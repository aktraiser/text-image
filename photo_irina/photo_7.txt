A person with shoulder-length auburn hair seated at a dining table in the outdoor area of a Nando's restaurant. They are wearing the same bright green t-shirt and turquoise earrings as in previous images, and have a thoughtful or concerned expression while looking off to the side. Their right hand is touching their chest/collar area. On the wooden table in front of them is a glass containing a yellow beverage, a white plate, and what appears to be food items. The background shows palm trees, other diners seated at nearby tables (some wearing masks), and the restaurant's red and blue umbrellas. The setting is well-lit, suggesting midday, and the person is seated in a rattan-style wooden chair. A shopping bag can be partially seen beside them. The restaurant appears to be located near water, with buildings visible in the distance.
