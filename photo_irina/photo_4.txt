A person with auburn hair styled in a bun sitting outdoors at a waterfront location during dusk. They are looking down at a mobile device held in their hand. The person is wearing a light-colored strapped top with a red wrap or cardigan draped over their shoulders. In the background, there are palm trees, water, and distant city lights visible across the bay. The setting appears to be an outdoor seating area with greenery and some wooden furniture.
