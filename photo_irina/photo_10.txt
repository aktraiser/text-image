A close-up portrait of a person with shoulder-length auburn hair holding a bouquet of flowers close to their face. They have a warm, gentle smile and are looking directly at the camera. The bouquet consists of pink alstroemeria (Peruvian lilies) and white hydrangeas creating a vibrant pink and white color combination. The person is wearing pearl drop earrings, different from the turquoise earrings seen in previous images. The setting is an indoor space with cream-colored curtains or drapes visible in the background. A decorative lamp can be seen to the left, and a Starbucks cup is partially visible on a surface in the background. The lighting is warm and appears to be artificial indoor lighting, suggesting the photo was taken in the evening. The close framing of the image creates an intimate atmosphere, with the flowers partially obscuring the lower portion of their face.
