A person with shoulder-length auburn hair standing in an urban plaza with a dramatic cityscape of skyscrapers in the background. They are wearing the same bright green t-shirt and turquoise earrings as in previous images. The setting appears to be Dubai, identifiable by the distinctive tall buildings and the illuminated "FMAAP" sign on what looks like the Dubai Mall. The photo is taken during blue hour or dusk, with the sky darkening while the buildings are illuminated with lights. The person has a neutral expression looking directly at the camera. Behind them, other visitors can be seen observing the skyline, and the paved area features yellow markings on the ground. The modern architecture of the surrounding buildings creates a striking contrast with the person in the foreground. The atmosphere suggests a popular tourist viewpoint in a major metropolitan area.
