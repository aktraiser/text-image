A person with auburn hair smiling at the camera while standing in an elegant European courtyard at dusk. They are wearing a light mint-green or pale blue dress with short sleeves and a gathered waist, and have blue sunglasses perched on top of their head. A white or cream-colored tote bag is slung over their right shoulder, and they're wearing a watch with a dark band on their wrist. The setting is a historic stone building with large arched windows and doorways that are illuminated from within, casting a warm glow against the blue evening sky. The courtyard floor features an artistic pattern of embedded lights that create a starry effect on the dark pavement. To the left, a small white pavilion or tent structure is visible. The atmosphere suggests a cultural venue or upscale location in Europe, possibly Paris, during the blue hour when daylight is fading. The person appears to be dressed for an evening event, with pearl earrings visible that match those seen in a previous image.
