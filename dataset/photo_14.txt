A close-up selfie of a person with long auburn hair smiling broadly at the camera in an evening urban setting. They are wearing a light beige or cream-colored top and distinctive large gold filigree dangling earrings, a notable change from the pearl earrings seen in previous images. The background reveals what appears to be a decorative public fountain or pool with colorful mosaic tiling and a sign indicating "BAIGNADE STRICTEMENT INTERDITE" (swimming strictly forbidden), suggesting the location is in France. Behind them stands a pink-hued apartment building, and to the right, illuminated decorative elements that may be part of a carousel or fairground attraction can be seen glowing against the darkening sky. The atmosphere suggests early evening, with the blue-gray cloudy sky creating a twilight ambiance while artificial lighting illuminates the urban features. The setting appears to be a public square or plaza in a French city, possibly Paris, combining architectural elements with recreational spaces. Their expression is notably cheerful compared to the more reserved or thoughtful expressions in some previous images.
