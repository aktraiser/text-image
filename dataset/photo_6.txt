A person with shoulder-length auburn hair displaying a concerned or displeased expression while seated at an outdoor restaurant. They are wearing the same bright green t-shirt and turquoise earrings with green dangles as in the previous image. The setting remains the outdoor seating area of a Nando's restaurant with red umbrellas visible in the background. Their eyebrows are furrowed, creating lines on their forehead, and their mouth is slightly open showing teeth in what appears to be a grimace or expression of concern. The lighting suggests it is daytime, and the same rattan-style chair is visible. The image is focused on their facial expression while the restaurant background is slightly blurred.
